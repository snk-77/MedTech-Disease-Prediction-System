# MedTech Disease Prediction System using Random Forest Classifier

The MedTech Disease Prediction System is a machine learningâ€“based application designed to predict possible diseases based on user-reported symptoms. Developed using Python and the Random Forest Classifier algorithm, this project takes a set of symptoms as input and classifies them into potential medical conditions. This system was created as part of a Python and Machine Learning internship at Code for India.

Diseases often begin with mild or overlapping symptoms, making early diagnosis difficult for non-specialists. By using a data-driven model, this project aims to assist individuals and healthcare professionals in identifying likely illnesses based on symptom patterns, helping promote early intervention and efficient healthcare delivery.

The system is built on a comprehensive dataset that maps various symptoms to corresponding diseases. Features include symptoms such as itching, skin rash, nodal skin eruptions, continuous sneezing, shivering, chills, joint pain, and stomach pain, among many others. The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and balancing class distributions where necessary.

For the classification task, the Random Forest algorithm was chosen due to its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional, multi-class problems effectively. The model combines predictions from multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce the risk of overfitting. Once trained, the model demonstrates high performance in correctly identifying diseases based on the input symptom set.

The system includes a user-friendly interface where users can select their symptoms from a list, and the model predicts the most probable disease. This prediction is accompanied by a confidence score, helping users understand the certainty of the diagnosis. The interface is designed to be minimal and functional, making it suitable for both educational and practical use cases.

This project reflects key concepts learned during the internship program, such as data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment. It also demonstrates the real-world application of machine learning in solving healthcare-related challenges through predictive analytics.

Future enhancements could include integrating additional features such as patient history, age, gender, and environmental factors to improve prediction accuracy. The model can also be extended into a web or mobile application, making it accessible for broader use in rural and underserved communities.

This project was developed during the Python and Machine Learning internship conducted by Code for India and serves as a foundation for more advanced healthcare AI systems.
